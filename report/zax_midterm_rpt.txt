The members of this group remains the same.
* Larry Resnik: lsresni2
* Zach Bian: zbian2

Our group has accomplished the following things.
* Decided on a plan of attack for crawling both Anime Lyrics dot Com and Piapro.
* Genres (top-most level) and album pages (second level) successfully retrieved from Anime Lyrics dot Com. Song pages (third/final level) not yet retrieved and still need to be extracted from album pages, but it is assumed to be a simple retrieval of anchor tags.
* Album pages are stripped of useless text before being stored locally.
* Six genre pages saved.
* ~5,000 pages crawled and stored locally.

Zach:
* Currently writing a crawler (C++) for piapro.
    * Made observations about its site structure to facilitate this. (URL, html sources, error messages, etc.)
* Found libraries for parsing html and dealing with UTF-8 chars. (piapro is in UTF-8 encoding, fortunately)

Significant changes:
* None
